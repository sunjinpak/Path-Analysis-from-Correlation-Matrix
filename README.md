# Path-Analysis-from-Correlation-Matrix

This Stata code performs path analysis using a predefined correlation matrix. The code initializes variables, sets sample size, defines a correlation matrix, and constructs the structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the relationships between the variables.

Code Overview
Define Variables:

Initializes the variables to be used in the path analysis.
Set Sample Size:

Sets the number of observations for the analysis.
Define Means and Standard Deviations:

The code sets the means and standard deviations for the variables (default values are used).
Define Correlation Matrix:

Specifies the correlation matrix that represents the relationships between the variables.
Display Data Summary:

Provides a status summary, description, and list of the variables.
Define the Model:

Constructs the SEM to analyze the direct and indirect effects of the predictor variables on the outcome variable.
